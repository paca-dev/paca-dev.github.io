# 7 Months of Job Hunting: Real Lessons from an Experienced Java Developer

## A Realistic Journey Through the 2025 Developer Job Market

Looking for a developer job today is a marathon, not a sprint. And when we talk about **Java developer jobs PACA** or elsewhere in Europe, reality can be discouraging. Here's the raw testimony of a Java developer with 10 years of experience who took 7 months to land a satisfying offer.

## The Numbers That Hurt (But Tell the Whole Story)

250 applications. 6 interviews. 7 months of searching.

These numbers might seem frightening, but they reflect the reality of today's **developer job market**. Our witness, an experienced Java developer working in Germany, lived through what many of you are going through: a long, sometimes discouraging process that can ultimately lead to a great opportunity.

### The Winning Strategy: Precision Over Quantity

Contrary to what you might think, he didn't apply randomly. Every application was strategic:

- **90% minimum match** with the job description
- **Tailored CV** for each job offer
- **Applied within the first 8 hours** after posting
- No cover letter (a deliberate choice)

This methodical approach is crucial, whether you're looking for **developer jobs Marseille**, **developer Aix-en-Provence**, or elsewhere in the **Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur** region.

## The Interviews: Between Hope and Disappointment

Out of 6 interviews obtained, here's what happened:

### The Instructive Failures
- **The failed assignment**: Sometimes you're just not at your best. Our witness's honesty is refreshing - he admits not investing enough in a technical exercise.
- **The toxic company**: 4 interview rounds, compliments from the manager, but a final rejection for dubious reasons. These companies exist, unfortunately.
- **The change of direction**: A company that stops recruiting mid-process. Frustrating but not uncommon.
- **The failed negotiation**: Rejected after mentioning his current salary.

### The Offer Rejected on Principle
One company offered only a 2% raise but a stock plan valued at one million euros. Our developer refused, preferring to wait for better. Sometimes, knowing how to say no is part of the strategy.

### The Final Success
The accepted offer: +20% salary, fewer stocks but a satisfying overall package.

## Technical Skills That Make the Difference

### Take-Home Assignments vs LeetCode

The most interesting observation concerns evaluation types:
- **50% take-home assignments**: where he excelled
- **50% LeetCode/System Design**: average performance

### The Recipe for Success on Take-Home Assignments

When he had projects to complete at home, our developer didn't do things halfway:

1. **Thoroughly understand** the requirements
2. **Ask relevant questions**
3. **Create a production-ready solution**
4. **Show all your skills**, even those not explicitly requested

The feedback was consistently positive: "impressive", "very good", "excellent".

## Concrete Advice for Your Developer Job Search

### 1. Filter Intelligently
Don't waste time on offers where you only have 50% of the skills. Target positions where you check 90% of the boxes, including the "nice to haves".

### 2. Timing is Everything
**Apply on the first day** of job posting. Competition is fierce, and recruiters often look at the first applications with more attention.

### 3. Adapt Your CV
A generic CV is a CV that ends up in the trash. Take 15 minutes to adapt your CV to each offer.

### 4. Prepare According to the Type of Evaluation

**For LeetCode/System Design exercises:**
- Train regularly
- Review classic patterns
- Practice problem-solving out loud

**For take-home assignments:**
- Read between the lines of the job description
- Create something more than what's asked
- Document your code like a pro
- Show you think production, not just demo

### 5. The Importance of Explicit Feedback
Always ask for feedback after each step. Explicit positive comments are an excellent indicator of your chances.
